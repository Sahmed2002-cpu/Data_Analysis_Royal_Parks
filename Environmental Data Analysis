# Environmental Data Analysis

## Objective
The project involved analyzing ecological data within The Royal Parks, focusing on trends in air quality, biodiversity, and green space health. This data was crucial for decision-making on park conservation strategies and sustainability initiatives.

## Skills Used
- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- SQL
- Tableau / Power BI for interactive data visualization

## Dataset
- Data on air quality, biodiversity surveys, and ecological health metrics collected from various sensors and surveys within The Royal Parks.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Collected air quality readings, biodiversity counts, and green space health metrics from sensors and manual surveys.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and normalized sensor data, removed outliers, and handled missing data.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the impact of seasonal changes on biodiversity and air quality.
   - Identified trends in air pollution across different regions of the parks.
4. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards showcasing air quality trends and biodiversity metrics.

## Results
- Identified an increase in biodiversity in reforested areas over the last 5 years.
- Air quality analysis showed a consistent improvement during low-traffic periods, which influenced policies to restrict vehicle access in certain zones.
  
## Conclusion
The insights led to more focused conservation efforts, particularly in areas with improving biodiversity and declining air quality. The findings also supported sustainability programs for park visitors.
